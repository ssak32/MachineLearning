Supervised learning:
-------------------
A typical supervised learning task is classification. In supervised learning, the training set you feed to the algorithm includes the desired solutions.

	Here are some of the most important supervised learning algorithms:
	-	k-Nearest Neighbors
	-	Linear Regression
	-	Logistic Regression
	-	Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
	-	Decision Trees and Random Forests
	-	Neural networks2

Root Mean Square Error (RMSE):
-----------------------------
RMSE(X,h) = 1m ∑ i=1 m h(x (i) )-y (i)  2

Mean absolute error (MAE):
-------------------------
MAE(X,h) = 1 m ∑ i=1 m h (x (i) ) - y (i)
